The KPK lingua became street slang, and many people were hooked. Ko Por Keh brought the young singer into the limelight as he nicked three nominations for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Headies" id="headies">Headies Award</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatz_Awards_2021" id="tba"> The Beatz Awards</a> which he was also nominated for a total of five times!

Imole was arrested alongside four others at their home in Lekki, Lagos for possesion of illegal substances like MMDA and cannabis, but was later released.

  <li><strong>2023:</strong> He released the Blessed Ep, his first after leaving Marlians Record Label, which shot up to the top spot on Apple Music in Nigeria. The month of April blessed him and his wife with a handsome son.
On 5 October 2022, MohBad accused his manager, singer Naira Marley, of assault and stated that his former boss ordered people to beat him up after he announced his intention to employ a different manager to handle his music and business affairs. In June, he filed a police report stating Samson Erinfolami Balogun, a music promoter nicknamed "Sam Larry" and a known associate of Marley's, had assaulted him and destroyed some of his property. In the report, MohBad said that Larry had interrupted a video shoot, leading a group of 15 men armed with firearms and cutlasses who claimed to work for monarch Oba Elegushi. Police later said MohBad had not attended a subsequent meeting to address the allegations, and that Balogun and others accused of the assault had then filed a defamation complaint. Elegushi released a statement distancing himself from Balogun.</li>

         For the age of 27, his voice was too rich and mature. So depressing!
